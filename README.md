<br> Hi, I am Jack! Glad to see you here!
<br> This is a unreal plugin for interaction with alibaba oss server! You can use it by blueprint with you accesskey directly.The plugin include almost the common usage which supply by alioss server Api.
<br>
<br> This Project is in a period of developing,so there may be some unconvenience. In this plug-in, I created a Functionlib that contains most of the AliOss common methods, but they need to pass in AccessKey and other account info for each method. 
<br>
<br>In normal use, you definitely don't expose AccessKey. Instead, you storeAccessKey in a more discreet way and don't change it often, so you might cache it as a local encryption file or access it through a request server or in a static class or the other way.So you may need modify the plugin in a way that is convenient to you.
<br>
<br>So if you have more good idea ,Please coommit your idea to the issue tab,or send me a email <596770421@qq.com>. Also welcome to join me and create a pullRequest to improve the project.
<br>
<br> Next we are going to develop a simple online game, if you are interested, welcome to join us!
